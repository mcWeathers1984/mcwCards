# mcwCards

**A lightweight terminal card game engine built with C++ and ncurses.**

This is a clean rebuild of my original card game system â€” redesigned for clarity, modularity, and full terminal control using ncurses. It supports Unicode card rendering and aims to handle a variety of card games like Poker, Blackjack, and Rummy.

## Build Instructions

```bash
make            # Build in release mode
make DEBUG=1    # Build in debug mode
make run        # Build and run
